// Implementation file for System.String
// Most methods are implemented inline in the header file due to the template nature
// and to improve compiler optimizations

#include "System/String.h"

// This file is mostly empty as the implementation is in the header
// It's included for completeness and to follow C++ best practices
// of separating interface from implementation
